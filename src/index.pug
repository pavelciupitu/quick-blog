        small Contrary to the perception that it would be a programmer blog, this  Quick Blog is a general blog, addressing topics from various areas of interest to me. Many are technology-focused, but I also write with the same pleasure about good food, pleasant holidays, politics, news around us and various other topics. I write a lot of articles every day and you always find something new and interesting here. Below are recommendations for good articles that you may have missed in their time.
